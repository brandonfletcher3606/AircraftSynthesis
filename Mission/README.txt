**READ ME**
Open up the initiateSim.m File from the top level folder. You can run this program straight without any input from the user.
This will show the structure of the program written. The output of the program is missionComplete. This is an array of all
the planform ran against the mission. Additionally, the first column of the structure represents what change is made in each
planform taken with respec to the very first planform in the structure. The first planform is the initial planform also called
the initial conditions.

If you have any questions please email me.
